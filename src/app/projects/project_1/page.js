        <p className="project-description">
        The client approached us with the need to streamline and improve the efficiency of their job scheduling process. The primary goal was to reduce the manual effort involved in scheduling jobs while ensuring that client information could be managed with ease. To address these challenges, we developed an automated scheduling system with integrated route optimization.
